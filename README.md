## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description

The purpose of this project is to improve the code by creating a backend using node.js, express.js server, and a mySQL database. It involves the creation of RESTful APIs that have CRUD functionality. Additionally, sequlize is used as an ORM tool to convert data to and from the database. Since this is a backend-only application, insomnia was used to make requests to the APIs and demonstrate their functionality.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

## User Story

```
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
